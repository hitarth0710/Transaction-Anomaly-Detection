# Transaction Anomaly Detection - Technical Documentation

## Overview

This application provides a user-friendly interface for detecting anomalous financial transactions using machine learning. It utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify transactions that deviate significantly from normal patterns.

## Technical Architecture

### Components

1. **User Interface (Tkinter)**
   - Input fields for transaction details
   - Visualization area for results
   - Status indicators and controls

2. **Core ML Framework**
   - Model loading and inference
   - Data preprocessing
   - Result interpretation

3. **Visualization Engine**
   - Transaction plotting
   - Threshold visualization
   - Anomaly highlighting

### Libraries Used

- **Tkinter**: GUI framework
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **joblib**: Model persistence

## Anomaly Detection Algorithm

### Isolation Forest

The application uses Isolation Forest, an algorithm particularly suited for anomaly detection:

- **Core Principle**: Anomalies are easier to isolate in random partitioning
- **Advantages**:
  - Works well with high-dimensional data
  - Low time and memory requirements
  - Does not require density estimation
  - Effective with small contamination rates

### Features Used

The model analyzes three key features:

1. **Transaction Amount**: The monetary value of the current transaction
2. **Average Transaction Amount**: Historical average for the customer
3. **Frequency of Transactions**: How often transactions occur

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow

1. User enters transaction details via GUI
2. Input is formatted and passed to the model
3. Model predicts if the transaction is anomalous
4. Results are displayed visually and textually

### Visualization Components

The visualization plots:
- A scatter representation of normal transactions
- A vertical threshold line separating normal from anomalous
- The current transaction highlighted in red (anomaly) or green (normal)

### Error Handling

The application implements comprehensive error handling:
- Model loading failures
- Input validation
- Runtime exceptions

## User Experience Design

The GUI is designed with the following principles:

1. **Simplicity**: Clean interface with minimal clutter
2. **Intuitive Flow**: Logical progression from input to result
3. **Visual Feedback**: Color-coding and clear status messages
4. **Convenience Features**: Quick sample loading for demonstration

## Evaluation

### Model Performance Considerations

- **Precision**: Proportion of correctly identified anomalies
- **Recall**: Ability to find all anomalies
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Limitations

- Fixed threshold visualization (simplified for GUI)
- Limited to three input features
- Pre-trained model without online learning

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - 3D plots for better feature representation
   - Historical transaction patterns

2. **Model Improvements**
   - Online learning capabilities
   - Multiple algorithm support
   - Confidence intervals for predictions

3. **Additional Features**
   - Transaction history tracking
   - Batch processing functionality
   - Report generation

4. **Interface Enhancements**
   - Dark/light theme toggle
   - Resizable interface
   - Advanced settings panel

## Development Notes

The core detection algorithm is encapsulated in the `modeling.py` module, making it easy to update or replace the underlying model without changing the GUI code. This separation of concerns follows good software engineering practices and allows for modular testing and development.
